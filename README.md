# 🐍 My python training Roadmap – From Beginner to Advanced   

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This collection of training exercises reflects my progress from Python fundamentals all the way to advanced skills.
I completed each stage of this roadmap through hands-on coding practice and real-world mini projects.  

---  

## 📘 Beginner Stage: Laying the Foundation   

✔️ **Basic Syntax** – Variables, data types, strings, numbers, and comments  
✔️ **Flow Control** – if/else statements, loops (for/while), conditionals  
✔️ **Functions** – Custom functions with arguments and return values  
✔️ **Data Structures** – Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets  

📚 Resources I used: [python.org](https://python.org), Youtube , https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python

## 🛠 Intermediate Stage: Getting Proficient  

✔️ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation    
✔️ **Error Handling** – try/except, finally  
✔️ **File Handling** – Reading and writing files in various modes  
✔️ **Modules & Libraries** – Standard libraries like `os`, `datetime`, and `random`  
✔️ **Databases** – sqlite3, simple SQLAlchemy usage
